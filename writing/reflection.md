# Cost of Living exercise group reflection

## Comparing data against communities that you're used to, what surprised you?

- I was pretty surprised to see how low the taxes were in Colorado and Massachusetts, in California I'm used to pretty much double that of Colorado's. However it was also really nice to see how affordable some places are, while still getting a good house that is not about to fall apart nor is a shoebox, which gives me hope for the skyrocketting housing market we know today. However, I was most surprised to learn that there are plenty of jobs out there that pay well that don't even require a college degree of any sorts, so I am pretty confident that I will be able to find a decent job in my desired field.

## How difficult was it to arrive at an optimal budget? A reasonable budget? Describe your challenges.

- It wasnt too hard but in some places I may have to spend significantly less on food and buy in bulk so that I can make it through each months of payments, which isn't ideal but at least it still works. It was most difficult in places where the taxes were high, and the price of living was also pretty high, i.e. California. I am not 100% sure how much I would be spending on my car every month, because repairs are also needed, so I usually put a extra one or two-hundred dollars onto the insurance coverage, that way any repairs would be covered.

## What lessons did you take away from this exercise?

- It is extremely important to do your research before moving ANYWHERE. Even if a place is your hometown and you're looking to get your own home, there are always things you may not think about like the gas you'll be using for work, what fixes your home may need, or even how much food really costs. There will also always be unexpected things that happen so it is always best to look ahead for those things and prepare for anything as much as possible.
